                Since your order is dispatched internationally, it has to be cleared through customs. Don't worry—just confirm your delivery information and we'll handle it for you. The delivery date provided at checkout accounts for clearance times.
                Be aware that some banks may charge a small transaction fee for orders dispatched internationally.                </p>

                Yes, you can save your delivery information in your settings prior to your order, and save your payment information when you place an order. Once saved, you can auto-populate your information for the next release.

                Keep your browser window open for a few minutes—a message will pop up to let you know if you got a pair or not. We'll also send you an email to let you know, usually within a couple of hours.

                To see Apple Pay as an option in the Nike App or on Nike.com, you'll need to use a compatible Apple device running the latest OS, be signed in to your iCloud account and have a supported card in your Wallet. Additionally, you'll need to use Safari to use Apple Pay on Nike.com.
